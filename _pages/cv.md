**PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE** 

**Data Scientist, R&D, T and T Consulting Services Inc**, Falls Church, VA  Nov 2019 - Present  

- Proposal automation product: QuerySmith 
- Ideated and developed comprehensive search and automation application, to build automated proposal draft by encoding user knowledge, resulting ~300% increase in proposal capabilities overall.  

`     `Part 1: Advanced Enterprise Search Engine   

- Implemented Elasticsearch based enterprise search engine prototype with semantic search module, tag filters, and in-place custom word cloud doc preview, with a from-scratch pipeline via API for Box. (Elasticsearch, API) 
- Dockerized and deployed with AWS Fargate the app, and the daily CRUD functions using enterprise API query, improving teams’ efficiency by 200%, beating standard doc search tools in speed and accuracy. (Docker, Flask) 

`     `Part 2: Semantic Search assistant  

- Developed context-based search module using NLP models and integrated with the search engine through Flask to boost search accuracy further by 50%.  (Neural Net, Skip-gram, topic modelling)*    
- Internal HR automation Module 
  - Developed applicant recommender system to increase proposals and contracts recruiting efficiency by 150% via NLP based resume feature extraction combined with ATS fields query, into consolidated statistics with ranks. 
- NIH’s international Heart Stroke AI Research  
  - Feasibility study on Federated Learning platforms, MLOps workflow and ETL tech stack to evaluate a compatible and efficient pipeline to build, train, and deploy models on heart stroke data from 4 countries. 
  - Delivery included prototype cost, data migration and logistics analysis as well. Lead to potential $850K award for next phase project. (Clara, MLflow, ML Lifecycle)    
- Well-Being Inventory (WBI) for suicide prevention           
- Implemented ML models based on survey data to predict well-being status (suicide indicators) and recommend resources for veterans and homeless to prevent suicides. (Signal Detection Theory, SVM, Logistic regression) 

**Research Associate I,** **CMU**,** Pittsburgh, PA           Aug 2018 - Nov 2019
